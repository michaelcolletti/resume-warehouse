## üöÄ Overview

Welcome to Michael's Resumes and Projects repository! This repository showcases my professional journey, skills, and projects in a unique and interactive way.

## üìÑ Resumes as Code

### Resumes Reimagined Using GitHub and MkDocs

In this section, you'll find my resumes presented as code. By leveraging the power of GitHub and MkDocs, I've transformed traditional resumes into dynamic, version-controlled documents. This approach not only highlights my technical skills but also ensures that my resumes are always up-to-date and easily accessible.

## üõ†Ô∏è Projects

Here are some of the projects I've worked and am working on:

- **Project Lomax aka LomaxesEverywhere**: Project Lomax delivers on John and Alan Lomax's vision allowing all to become their groups Lomax. Using LLMS to persist disappearing languages and cultures, whilst keeping data private and secure. 
- **Project Sonify**: Sonify all the things. We are sonic creatures.
- **Project DomainLookUp**: Utility for Domians lookup.
- **Layer** A Migration Platform for any type of Metadata
- **Project AllMyAllergies.com**: Create your very own static website based on your food sensitivities and deploy on our platform
