## üöÄ Overview

Welcome to Michael's Resumes and Projects repository! This repository showcases my professional journey, skills, and projects in a unique and interactive way.

## üìÑ Resumes as Code

### Resumes Reimagined Using GitHub and MkDocs

In this section, you'll find my resumes presented as code. By leveraging the power of GitHub and MkDocs, I've transformed traditional resumes into dynamic, version-controlled documents. This approach not only highlights my technical skills but also ensures that my resumes are always up-to-date and easily accessible.

## üõ†Ô∏è Projects

Here are some of the projects I've worked and am working on:

- **Project Lomax**: Project Lomax delivers on John and Alan Lomax's vision.
- **Project Sonify**: Sonify all the things.
- **Project DomainLookUp**: Utility for Domians.
- **Project AllMyAllergies.com**: Create your very own static website based on your food sensitivities and deploy on our platform
